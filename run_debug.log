3. Creating model...
Loading pretrained model: hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2
Some weights of Wav2Vec2Model were not initialized from the model checkpoint at hf-internal-testing/tiny-random-wav2vec2 and are newly initialized: ['feature_extractor.conv_layers.1.layer_norm.bias', 'feature_extractor.conv_layers.1.layer_norm.weight', 'feature_extractor.conv_layers.2.layer_norm.bias', 'feature_extractor.conv_layers.2.layer_norm.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
